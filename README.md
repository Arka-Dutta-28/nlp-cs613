# Assignment 1

## Overview
This repository contains code and outputs for a data analysis and model evaluation task. Since GitHub does not display Colab files with their output, we are providing links to the Colab notebooks with viewing permissions to allow you to access and explore the results directly.

Additionally, we have uploaded the `roman_test.csv` file, which is essential for generating the confusion matrix and the associated graph.

## Files Included
- **Colab Notebooks**: Links to the Colab notebooks with the results and visualizations.
- **roman_test.csv**: CSV file containing the necessary data for generating the confusion matrix and graph.
- **Colab Notebooks (GitHub)**: The same Colab notebooks are uploaded in the GitHub repository, but they do not display output due to rendering issues.

## Colab Notebook Links

### 1. Table 1: Results
The table below summarizes the results of our analysis. You can view it in the following Colab notebook:

[Table 1: Results](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1prfYw4o2j7uaXDXWmB2LZjQMaVcDGNTE?usp=sharing)

### 2. Confusion Matrix and Graph
The confusion matrix, along with a graphical representation, is available at this link:

## File Description

### 1. `roman_test.csv`
This CSV file contains the dataset used for generating the confusion matrix and graph. The file must be used as input in the Colab notebooks to recreate the analysis.

You can download it from the repository and upload it to the Colab notebooks to ensure that the results and visualizations are generated as expected.

### 2. Colab Notebooks
- The first notebook contains the **Table 1** results, which summarize the outputs of the model and other analysis metrics.
- The second notebook generates the **Confusion Matrix** and the **Graph** based on the analysis of the dataset.

**Note:** While the Colab notebooks have been uploaded to this repository, they will not display their output here due to a rendering issue with GitHub. You will need to open the notebooks in Google Colab (via the provided links) to view the results and graphs.

## Instructions to View and Run the Notebooks

1. Click the links provided above to open the Colab notebooks in your browser.
2. In the Colab notebooks, make sure to upload the `roman_test.csv` file using the file upload functionality in Colab.
3. Run the code cells in the notebooks to view the results and the confusion matrix graph.

## Notes
- The results presented are based on the data in `roman_test.csv`. Please ensure that the file is correctly uploaded to Colab to reproduce the output.
- The Colab notebooks are also uploaded in this repository. However, they will **not** display the output directly on GitHub due to rendering limitations. For full access to the outputs, use the provided external Colab links.
  
## Conclusion
This repository provides all the necessary files to run the analysis and visualize the model's performance through a confusion matrix and graph. Please refer to the provided Colab notebook links for a detailed view of the results.
